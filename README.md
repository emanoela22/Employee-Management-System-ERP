Working on building a full employee management system using React and Node. 
This project is a learning curve to explore an industry that has not been introduced before to me.

This project uses:
React
Node
Axios (to send employee data to the database)
JWT tokenizer (packages for authentication)
MYSQL

This project will collect users data and store them securily in a database. 
The database will contain all the logic for managing employees and their data.
